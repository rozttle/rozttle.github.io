        I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print
        materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.

        I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for Fishes & Flying Things came from the material practices
        of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art exhibition I had on at the time. From
        this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to tell a circular story but when people got to the end
        they stopped reading because that’s the way books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first;
        the story circled round and round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one
        copy. The QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of which
        I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still works.

        The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
        relationship. This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at
        Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
        influential online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a word-processed
        photocopied booklet which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
        trAce’s last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
